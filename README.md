# matrix-determinant

This program compares the performance of two methods for calculating the determinant of a square matrix: brute-force, and LU decomposition. Spoiler: LU decomposition wins, and it's not even close.

It was originally written for a scientific programming class. You may see the attached pdf file for the report that I submitted along with it, which presents data comparing the two methods.
